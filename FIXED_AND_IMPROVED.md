## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Backend
```
/api/chat
├── Scrape CASA & GDrone (live data)
├── Generate AI response (with fallback)
├── Return formatted response
└── Include source links
```

### Scraping Process
```
User Query → Scrape Websites → Compile Context → AI Response → User
              ↓ (if fails)
           Use Fallback Content
```

### Error Handling
```
OpenAI API Fails → Use Fallback Responses → Still Provide Value
Scraping Fails → Use Cached Content → Continue Working
Network Error → Show Helpful Message → Allow Retry
```
