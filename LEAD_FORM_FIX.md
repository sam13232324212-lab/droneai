# Lead Form Popup - Fixed Behavior

## âœ… Issue Fixed

**Problem:** When user clicks "Later" on the "Connect with an Expert" popup, it never shows again.

**Solution:** Implemented smart reappearance logic.

## ðŸ”„ New Behavior

### How It Works Now:

1. **First Appearance:** After 3 AI responses
   - Shows "Get personalized guidance from a DroneCareerPro expert..."
   
2. **User Clicks "Later":** Popup closes

3. **Reappearance:** After 3 MORE AI responses
   - Shows again with updated text: "Still have questions? Let our experts provide personalized guidance..."
   
4. **Pattern Continues:** Every 3 messages until user submits

5. **After Submission:** Never shows again (lead captured)

## ðŸ“Š Timeline Example

```
Message 1: "What is RePL?" â†’ AI responds
Message 2: "How much does training cost?" â†’ AI responds  
Message 3: "What are career options?" â†’ AI responds

[2 seconds later] â†’ Popup appears

User clicks "Later" â†’ Popup closes

Message 4: "Tell me about ReOC" â†’ AI responds
Message 5: "Compare training providers" â†’ AI responds
Message 6: "What's the salary range?" â†’ AI responds

[2 seconds later] â†’ Popup appears again (different text)

User fills form â†’ Popup never shows again âœ“
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

**Smart Tracking:**
- Tracks message count
- Tracks last time popup was shown
- Calculates messages since last appearance

**User-Friendly:**
- 2-second delay before showing (not intrusive)
- Different message on reappearance
- Persistent but not annoying
- Stops permanently after submission

**Code Implementation:**
```javascript
// State tracking
const [lastShownAt, setLastShownAt] = useState(0);

// Show every 3 messages
const messagesSinceLastShown = messageCount - lastShownAt;

if (messagesSinceLastShown >= 3) {
  setShowLeadForm(true);
  setLastShownAt(messageCount);
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Works Better

**Before:**
- Showed once at 3 messages
- Never appeared again if dismissed
- Lost opportunity to capture interested users

**After:**
- Shows initially at 3 messages
- Reappears every 3 messages if dismissed
- Gives multiple chances to capture leads
- Shows persistence without being pushy
- Different messaging on reappearance shows awareness

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Test the behavior:
1. Ask 3 questions â†’ Popup appears
2. Click "Later" â†’ Popup closes
3. Ask 3 more questions â†’ Popup appears again
4. Submit form â†’ Popup never shows again
